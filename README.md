Assignment 1.1: Your favorite HTML and CSS resource

Apart from the resources we have in Canvas, I found a really helpful link (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-introduction-to-html-and-css). Its a very quick and easy to understand for a beginner like me. The article provides an assignment, and additional resources to further understand HTML and CSS. The webs page explains that HTML and CSS are two languages that create everything we see on the internet. HTML is like the instructions to create the website, and CSS is to style to those instructions.
