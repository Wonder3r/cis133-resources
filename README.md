Assignment 1.1: Your favorite HTML and CSS resource

Apart from the resources we have in Canvas, I found a really helpful link (https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/what-is-html). This is a 6 minute read article that explains what HTML is, providing videos and other helpful links to learn more. The page is clean, no crazy ads, and quick to find the information as it has a table of contents.
